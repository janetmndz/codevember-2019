# Codevember 2019
My contributions to Codevember challenges in 2019


## What is Codevember?
>Codevember is a challenge for developers to sharpen their creativity and improve their skills. The goal is to build a creative piece of code every day of November. We give you daily hints to inspire you but you can do unrelated sketches.
